# digitOCR
A neural network which interprets numbers(0-9) from handwritten images.
# About the project
This project is a Shallow Neural Network (which has one hidden layer) without the use of any Machine Library library like sklearn etc. The only library function used here is a gradient descent function from scipy package.
# Files and their functions:
<b>images.mat</b>: Contains the training set for the neural network<br>
<b>init_weights.mat</b>: General convention denies using zeros as initial weights, so, these are random values.<br>
<b>ref_weights.mat</b>: Weights saved by network for fast recognition without training the network over again.<br>
<b>test_imgs</b>: Contains .tiff format image of each class for recognition.<br>
